-----------------------------------------------
+CHANGES - ESP Ghostscript 8.15.1 - 03/08/2005
+---------------------------------------------
+
+CHANGES IN 8.15.1
+
+	- Fix the opvp problem that fails to handle index colored BW images.
+	- The PNG devices were missing from the configure script
+	  (STR #1113)
+	- The opvp driver requires both dlopen() and
+	  iconv_open() support, which were not checked in the
+	  configure script (STR #1107)
+	- RPMs created using the ghostscript.spec file did not
+	  include the correct fontpath (STR #1112)
+	- The previous default mapping of stdout to stderr
+	  caused problems for some programs (STR #1108)
+	- Re-added section to README which tells that all
+	  non-obsolete compile-in drivers and UPP files as
+	  listed on linuxprinting.org are included
+	- Added remaining old Japanese printer drivers:
+	  "dmprt",  "escpage", "lp2000", "npdl", "rpdl" (Thanks
+	  to Werner Fink from SuSE for converting them to the
+	  new API, STR #1094)
+	- Fixed C99-isms in several add-on drivers that
+	  prevented compiles to work on non-C99 compilers (STR
+	  #1104, STR #1114)
+	- Fixed segfault problem of opvp driver on AMD64.
+	- Fixed gamma correction bug of opvp driver.
+	- Fixed illegal color conversion bug on opvp gray device.
+	- Fixed opvp segfault problem caused by Ghostscript 8.15 
+	  font rasterization.
+	- Fixed lips4v segfault problem caused by Ghostscript 8.15
+	  font rasterization.
+	- Fixed Makefile.in to also compile the PNG and JBIG2 stuff
+	- Added the free Epson Kowa laser printer drivers for the EPL
+          (non-L) series, the AcuLaser series, and the japanese LP
+          series

+HACKING - ESP Ghostscript Coding Rules
+--------------------------------------
+
+This file describes the basic coding rules for all contributions
+to ESP Ghostscript.  These rules MUST be followed to ensure that
+ESP Ghostscript can be compiled and used on as many platforms as
+possible.
+
+1. All C source files and headers MUST only use features from ANSI C.
+   You may not use features specific to GCC or C99, including:
+
+   a. C++ COMMENTS FORBIDDEN; you may not use the C++/C99 comment
+      prefix "//".  Instead, use "/* your comment */".
+
+   b. MIXING DECLARATIONS AND CODE; you may not define a variable in
+      the middle of a code block, for example:
+
+          int i;
+          i = 0;
+          int j;
+          j = 0;
+
+      is not valid ANSI C code while:
+
+          int i = 0;
+          int j = 0;
+
+      and:
+
+          int i;
+          int j;
+          i = 0;
+          j = 0;
+
+      *are* valid ANSI C.
+
+   c. VARIABLE DECLARATIONS IN FOR LOOPS; variable declarations in "for"
+      loops are not allowed in ANSI C, for example:
+
+          for (int i = 0; i < 10; i ++)
+
+      is not valid ANSI C.
+
+   d. INLINE IS NOT A SUPPORTED KEYWORD; the "inline" keyword is not
+      part of ANSI C, but is a GCC and C99 extension.
+
+2. Operating-system-specific code must be #ifdef'd, either using
+   the corresponding system define(s) or via autoconf tests.
+
+3. All code/modules/drivers must be provided under the GPL, LGPL, or
+   GNU-compatible license.

+This package is based very heavily on the work of Uli Wortmann
+(uli@bonk.ethz.ch), and I do not claim to be the original author of very
+much of this code.  Uli has done a tremendous amount of excellent work, and
+this package is a modification to his driver by me to add the ability to print
+to the DeskJet 880C, 882C, and 895C printers.  Under the terms of the GNU
+General Public License (see LICENSING TERMS below), I am distributing this
+package under the same license.
+
+Please also see the file readme.hp8 for Uli's notes about the package.
+
+It is my intent to submit this work as a patch to Uli Wortmann for inclusion
+in the original HP850C driver package.

+as you can.
+
+SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
+
+This package is designed to work with Aladdin Ghostscript 5.50 (available
+from ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/aladdin/gs550/).  It may work with earlier
+versions of Ghostscript, but I have not tested it.  You can follow the
+directions included to compile Ghostscript, but here are is a condensed
+version that worked for me:
+
+INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
+
+1.  Obtain the files 
+       
+       ghostscript-5.50.tar.gz            2826251 bytes 
+       jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz                  613261 bytes 
+       libpng-1.0.2.tar.gz                 225386 bytes 
+       zlib-1.1.3.tar.gz                   168463 bytes
+       ghostscript-fonts-std-5.50.tar.gz  1444863 bytes 
+       
+2.  Create a directory to perform the build in, for example,
+    /usr/local/src/gs.  Unpack each of the files into this directory:
+    
+    $ cd /usr/local/src
+    $ mkdir gs ; cd gs
+    $ tar zxvf $HOME/ghostscript-5.50.tar.gz
+    $ tar zxvf $HOME/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
+    $ tar zxvf $HOME/libpng-1.0.2.tar.gz
+    $ tar zxvf $HOME/zlib-1.1.3.tar.gz
+    
+3.  Copy all the files from this driver package into the ghostscript
+    directory.  For example,
+    
+    $ cp $HOME/hp850C-880p/* /usr/local/src/gs/gs5.50/
+    
+    This will overwrite the files contrib.mak and makefile.  This is OK.
+
+4.  If desired, edit the makefile.  This should only be necessary if you
+    want to build a ghostscript binary that uses your existing PNG and
+    ZLIB libraries dynamically.  Normally ghostscript compiles these in
+    statically.  Note that you still need to download the sources to those
+    libraries (as listed in step 1) even if you want to link dynamically.
+    
+5.  There is a bug (I think) in the ghostscript source.  If during the make
+    it fails to build due to a missing "arch.h" in the file std.h, you can
+    fix it by changing line 28 of std.h from
+    
+        #include "arch.h"
+        
+    to
+    
+        #include "obj/arch.h"
+
+6.  Type 'make'.
+
+7.  Type 'make install' (as root).
+
+7.  To specify the 880C/882C/895C driver, use -sDEVICE=cdj880:
+
+    $ gs test.ps -sDEVICE=cdj880 -dNOPAUSE -dSAFER -sOutputFile=- | lpr
+    
+
+Please, please, please report any bugs to me at mgelhaus@proaxis.com.  This
+includes installation instruction bugs, because I was doing this from
+memory!

+                                                               淺山 和典

+
+
+========================================================================
+● １． はじめに
+========================================================================
+
+  Ghostscript 5.10 に付属の DeskJet 用ドライバ (gdevcdj.c) に手を加えて
+Hewlett Packard 社の DeskJet 505J (Plus) 用のドライバを追加したものです。
+カラー印刷も可能です。
+
+========================================================================
+● ２． 組込み
+========================================================================
+
+  次の手順で組み込みます。
+
+(1) gdevcdj.c にパッチ gdevcdj.dif を当てる。
+(2) gdev505j.mak を makefile に追加する。
+(3) makefile の DEVICE_DEVS(または DEVICE_DEVS1〜DEVICE_DEVS9 の何れか)
+    に dj505j.dev を追加する。
+(4) make を実行する。
+
+========================================================================
+● ３． 使い方
+========================================================================
+
+  モノクロ印字の場合は他のドライバと同様です。オプション
+"-sDEVICE=dj505j" 付きで gs を起動してください。
+
+  カラー印字は、gs の起動オプションに "-dBitsPerPixel=3" を追加します。
+
+  詳しくは Ghostscript 5.10 の配布に含まれる devices.txt の DeskJet 系
+ドライバの使い方の説明をご覧ください。
+
+========================================================================
+● ４． 備考
+========================================================================
+
+  カラー印刷の場合、全体的に色が緑がかりますが、これは DeskJet のカラー
+インクの特性です。DeskJet 505J は CMY による 3 色刷りです。このため CMYK
+の 4 色刷りに比べて黒がきれいに出ません。
+
+  カラー印刷は多くのメモリを必要とします。1 pixel 当たり 1byte のフレー
+ムバッファを確保するためですが、このドライバに必要なメモリの他に gs 本体
+の動作に必要なメモリもありますから、A4 サイズの出力を行うためには 10 数
+MB のメモリが必要です。

+========================================================================
+● ２． はじめに
+========================================================================
+
+  このパッケージは Ghostscript version 2.6.1 を DJ's GPP でコンパイルし、
+NEC PC-9801/PC-H98、IBM PC/AT 互換機で利用できるようにするためのパッケー
+ジです。
+
+  作成されるバイナリは全機種共通です。機種は自動判別されます (ユーザが直
+接機種を指定することも可能です)。
+
+  また片山紀生さんによる日本語化パッケージ 1.0 と併用することを前提とし
+ていますが、Makefile を書き換えれば日本語化されていないものもコンパイル
+可能です。
+
+
+========================================================================
+● ３． 機種・OS依存性に関して
+========================================================================
+
+  このパッケージに含まれているもののうち、以下のものを除いて機種や OS に
+関係なくそのまま使用することが出来ます。
+
+ ・ gp_djgpp.c gp_pc98.c gp_pcat.c gp_djgpp.h djgpp.h
+      これはプラットフォーム依存のコード (ここでは DJ's GPP+GO32 用) を
+    定義したファイルです。Ghostscript のオリジナルパッケージには各環境用
+    のものが用意されていますので、GO32 環境以外のかたはそちらを利用して
+    ください。
+ ・ djgpp.mak djgpp.dif
+      DJ's GPP でコンパイルするための差分と makefile です。
+ ・ gp_djgpp.ps gp_site.ps
+      このパッケージを使って DJ's GPP でコンパイルした実行形式のための初
+    期化ファイルです。
+ ・ gdevdjgp/ gdevpc98/ gdev98hf/
+      ディスプレイドライバ各種。機種依存です。
+
+
+========================================================================
+● ４． コンパイルの方法
+========================================================================
+
+  次の手順でコンパイルしてください。
+
+(1) オリジナルのソースのアーカイブを展開する。以下の作業は、この作業によ
+    って作られる./gs261 というディレクトリに移って行います。
+
+(2) バグフィクス差分を当てます。
+
+(3) このパッケージに含まれているファイル及び日本語化パッケージのファイル
+    をこのディレクトリにコピーします。
+
+(4) パッチ djgpp.dif、及び日本語化差分をあてます (順序は問わない)。
+    djgpp.dif は genconf.c および ps2epsi.ps に対する差分です。
+
+    日本語化を行わない場合には djgpp.dif だけを適用してください。
+
+      patch < gs261j.dif
+      patch < djgpp.dif
+
+
+        ※パッチがうまく当たらない場合。
+
+          Ghostscript オリジナルのファイル (バグ修正差分を含む)、日本語
+          化パッチ (gs261j.diff)、DJ's GPP 対応パッチ (djgpp.dif)、は全
+          て UN*X 形式の改行コード (Line Feed のみ) です。MS-DOS 版の
+          patch.exe では、そのポーティングによってはうまくパッチが当たら
+          ないことがあるかもしれません。
+
+          このような場合は、総てのファイルの改行コードを MS-DOS 形式
+          (Carriage Return + Line Feed) に変更してから patch.exe を使う
+          か、あるいは UN*X 上でパッチを当てるところまでの作業を行ってそ
+          れから MS-DOS 上にファイルを持ってきて以下の作業を行なってくだ
+          さい。
+
+(5) 日本語化パッケージ、またはこのパッケージに付属しているデバイスドライ
+    バを組み込む場合には、それをカレントディレクトリにコピーする (これら
+    のデバイスドライバはディレクトリ drivers にあります)。
+
+    日本語化パッケージに付属のプリンタドライバのなかにはさらに差分を当て
+    る必要があるものがあります。またオリジナルのパッケージに付属のプリン
+    タドライバを組み込むためには前処理が必要です。
+
+    詳しくはこのドキュメントの「プリンタドライバの組込み」をご覧ください。
+
+    なおこのパッケージに付属のプリンタドライバ・ディスプレイドライバは前
+    処理なしでそのまま組み込めます。
+
+(6) djgpp.mak を編集する。
+
+    DJ's gpp 環境の Makefile は djgpp.mak というファイルです。この中の以
+    下のマクロを書き換えます。
+
+    (A)
+        DJGPP_PLATFORMS= ...
+
+        プリンタ出力ルーチンなどの機種依存コードをどの機種用のものを組み
+        込むかを指定します。主にプリンタ出力関係のコードです。ディスプレ
+        イ出力に関してはこれとは別に DEVICE_DEVS で指定します。NEC
+        PC-9801、IBM PC/AT 互換機用のプリンタ出力ルーチンが用意されてい
+        ます。
+
+        pc98_、pcat_ から選びます。両方を指定することも可能です。このパ
+        ッケージに含まれている djgpp.mak では両方を組み込むようにしてあ
+        ります。
+
+        この指定を空にしておくと機種依存コードを組み込まず全てのプリンタ
+        コードは標準プリンタ出力 ("PRN") 経由で出力されるようになります。
+
+    (B)
+        FEATURE_DEVS= ...
+
+        漢字フォントドライバを追加したい場合にはここに書き加えます。
+
+        このパッケージに含まれる djgpp.mak では、書体倶楽部フォント、JG
+        フォント、NEC PC-9801 ROM フォント、を利用する漢字フォントドライ
+        バを組み込むようになっています。
+
+        VFlib ver 2.13 以降と併用することにより漢字 TrueType フォントを
+        利用できるようになります。詳しくは kfvflib.sj をご覧ください。
+
+        また、日本語化を行わない場合には、kanji.dev 以降行末までを削除し
+        てください。
+
+    (C)
+        DEVICE_DEVS= ...
+        DEVICE_DEVS1=
+         :
+         :
+        DEVICE_DEVS9=
+
+        プレビューア、プリンタドライバなどの出力ドライバをここに空白文字
+        で区切ってならべます。
+
+        DEVICE_DEVS、DEVICE_DEVS1〜DEVICE_DEVS9 の 10 個のマクロに分けて
+        あるのは MS-DOS のコマンドライン長の制限のためです。たくさんのデ
+        バイスドライバを組み込む場合には、一つのマクロの定義が長くなりす
+        ぎないように 10 個に適当に振り分けてください。
+
+        このパッケージに含まれている djgpp.mak では何も組み込まないよう
+        になっています。
+
+        通常はディスプレイドライバは組み込む必要があります。
+
+         機種           デバイス名 ソースコードがあるディレクトリ
+         PC-9801/PC-H98 pc98.dev   drivers/gdevpc98/
+         IBM PC/AT      djgpp.dev  drivers/gdevdjgp/
+
+        日本語化パッケージ、及びこのパッケージに付属のデバイスドライバを
+        組み込む場合には、それぞれのソースプログラムを他の Ghostscript
+        のソースプログラムのあるディレクトリにコピーし、さらにそれぞれの
+        ドライバに付属の Makefile の内容を djgpp.mak に追加、または
+        !include " ファイル名 " として取り込んでください。
+
+    DJ's GPP の 1.12 以降を使う場合には、djgpp.mak 内のマクロ AOUT2EXE
+    の定義を 'coff2exe' に書き換えてください。デフォルトでは 'aout2exe'
+    になっています。
+
+(7) djgpp.mak を Makefile として make を実行する。
+
+      make -f djgpp.mak
+
+      djgpp.mak は Borland make 用です。その他の make を使う場合には、こ
+    のパッケージに付属の tarcat.pl を使って 「!include " ファイル名 "」
+    の部分をその中味で置き換えて、それを Makefile として使ってください。
+    perl スクリプトです。以下のようにして使います。このスクリプトでは
+    !include は入れ子になっていても処理できます。
+
+      jperl tarcat.pl djgpp.mak > merged.mak
+
+      make 用のバッチファイル (gsaddmod.bat など) はオリジナルのパッケー
+    ジに含まれる Turbo C++/Borland C++ 用のものをそのまま用います。この
+    パッケージではさらにオリジナルのパッケージのものに加えて
+    gssetdjg.bat というバッチファイルが追加されています。カレントディレ
+    クトリ (gs261) にこれらのバッチファイルがあることを確認してください。
+
+      このパッケージに含まれていないデバイスドライバを PC-9801 や PC/AT
+    互換機に対応させるための方法は本ドキュメントの最後に記してあります。
+
+
+========================================================================
+● ５． 使用法
+========================================================================
+
+  ここでは、DJ's GPP 版特有のことについてのみ述べます。Ghostscript 一般
+の設定作業、使用法についてはオリジナルのドキュメントをご覧ください。
+
+-----------
+★ 5.1 設定
+-----------
+
+(1) このパッケージの kanji ディレクトリにある PostScript ファイルを日本
+    語化パッケージの kanji ディレクトリ下のファイルと同じディレクトリに
+    コピーする。
+
+(2) このパッケージに含まれる gp_djgpp.ps と gp_site.ps を Ghostscript の
+    ライブラリを置くディレクトリ (gs_init.ps などを置くディレクトリ) に
+    コピーする。
+
+(3) 必要であれば gp_site.ps の機種指定部分などを編集する。
+
+      本バージョンでは機種 (98/PC/ その他) は自動判別します。したがって、
+    運がよければ特に設定を行なう必要はなく、そのまま使えます。
+
+      が、場合によっては判定を誤るかもしれません。その場合には、
+    gp_site.ps を以下のように編集して「明示的に」機種を指定してください。
+
+      具体的には、付属の gp_site.ps には可能な設定がコメント ('%' 以降改
+    行まで) 化されていますので、それらのうちひとつを Uncomment してくだ
+    さい。
+
+    % /Name (PC-AT)      % ...
+    % /Name (PC-9801)    % ...
+    % /Name (OTHER)      % ...
+
+    の行頭の '%' のうちひとつを取り除きます。
+
+      なお、自動判別を行なった場合には、自動的にその機種に /Name が設定
+    されます。
+
+
+      以下はオプショナルな設定なので通常は必要ありません。デフォルトの設
+    定でうまくいかない場合やデフォルトの設定で不満なときにこれらの設定を
+    行なってください。
+
+(4) プリンタ出力の方法の指定 (/PrintTarget)
+(5) プリンタ出力バッファのサイズの指定 (/PrintBufferSize)
+(6) プリンタ出力の速さの指定 (/PrintWait)
+(7) デフォルトのデバイスドライバの指定 (/DefaultDevice)
+
+  /Name の設定を行うと、
+
+ ・ プリンタ出力の方法 (/PrintTarget など)
+ ・ デフォルトのデバイスドライバ (/DefaultDevice)
+
+が、各機種にあったものに自動的に設定されます。
+
+  ここで、各設定の意味は以下のようになっています。
+
+ ・ /PrintTarget
+      プリンタ出力を、プリンタポート、プリンタ BIOS、標準プリンタ出力、
+    のうちのどれを用いて行うかを設定します。
+      (PORT),(PORT1),(PORT2),(PORT3),(BIOS),(STDPRN) のどれかの値をとり
+    ます。(PORT) と (PORT1) は等価です。
+
+      デフォルトは PC-9801、IBM PC/AT 互換機では (BIOS)、それ以外では
+    (STDPRN) です。
+
+ ・ /PrintBufferSize
+      プリンタ出力用のバッファのバイト数です。プリンタに送られるデータは
+    一旦このバッファに貯えられ、バッファがいっぱいになったときにまとめて
+    プリンタに送信されます。64 以上 32767 以下の整数です。デフォルトでは
+    1024(bytes) です。
+
+ ・ /PrintWait
+      プリンタ出力時の「待ち」です。この設定値が大きいほどゆっくりと出力
+    されます。「待ち」は /PrintBufferSize ぶんのデータを出力するごとに入
+    り、待ち時間は設定値の二乗にほぼ比例します。
+
+      LAN 環境やプリンタスプーラでプリンタ BIOS をフックしている場合にプ
+    リンタコードをとりこぼしてしまうようなときにはこの値を大きく設定する
+    か、この値をある程度の大きさに設定しておいて /PrintBufferSize の値を
+    小さくします。
+
+      /PrintBufferSize の値が小さいほど頻繁に「待ち」が発生することにな
+    り、/PrintWait の値が大きいほど一回あたりの「待ち」が長くなることに
+    なります。
+
+      設定できる値は 0 以上 2048 以下の整数です。デフォルトでは 0(待ちな
+    し) です。
+
+ ・ /DefaultDevice
+      Ghostscript を -sDEVICE=<driver> オプションを指定せずに、かつ環境
+    変数 GS_DEVICE を設定せずに立ち上げた場合に使用するデバイスドライバ
+    です。通常は機種にあったディスプレイドライバを指定しておきます。
+
+      コマンドラインで
+
+      gs -h
+
+    と Ghostscript を立ち上げたときに、
+
+      Available devices:
+
+    という部分に出力されるもの中から選びます。
+
+  /Name 毎の各デフォルト値は、
+
+         +---------+-----------------------------------------+
+         |/Name    |/PrintTarget     /DefaultDevice          |
+         +---------+-----------------------------------------+
+         |(PC-AT)  |ポート1番        (djgpp)  -sDEVICE=djgpp |
+         |(PC-9801)|ポート           (pc98)  -sDEVICE=pc98   |
+         |(OTHER)  |標準プリンタ出力 nulldevice  -dNODISPLAY |
+         +---------+-----------------------------------------+
+
+で、/Name がいずれの場合も /PrintWait は 0、/PrintBufferSize は 1024 で
+す。
+
+  これらはユーザが gp_site.ps 中で /PrintTarget、/DefaultDevice などを明
+示的に指定することによって変更することが出来ます。
+
+  指定の方法は、
+
+  /DefaultDevice (pc98)
+
+のように、
+
+  /指定項目 値
+
+とします。gp_site.ps に設定例をコメントとして記述してありますので参考に
+してください。
+
+    ※  '%' 以降、行末まではコメントです。
+
+  /Name に (OTHER) を指定したときには、機種依存の動作を全く行いません。
+NEC PC-9801 や IBM PC/AT 互換機以外の機種で利用する場合にはこれを指定し
+てください。プリンタ出力は標準プリンタ出力を使い、デフォルトのデバイスは
+nulldevice (グラフィック画面への出力を一切行わないデバイス。コマンドライ
+ンで -dNODISPLAY を指定した場合と等価) になります。
+
+
+========================================================================
+● ６． プリンタドライバの組込み
+========================================================================
+-----------------------------------------
+★ 6.1 本パッケージ付属のプリンタドライバ
+-----------------------------------------
+
+  各プリンタドライバのドキュメントにしたがって組み込んでください。
+
+
+-----------------------------------------------
+★ 6.2 日本語化パッケージ付属のプリンタドライバ
+-----------------------------------------------
+
+  drivers ディレクトリの下の各サブディレクトリに拡張子.dif のファイルが
+ある場合には、それは gs 2.6.1 日本語化パッケージに付属のプリンタドライバ
+に対する差分です。この差分をあてることにより日本語化パッケージに付属のプ
+リンタドライバが使えるようになります。
+
+  日本語化差分に付属のプリンタドライバははじめから NEC PC-9801 に対応し
+ている場合もありますが、NEC PC-H98 や IBM PC/AT 互換機に対応させるために
+はこのパッケージに付属の差分をあててください。PC-9801 で使用する場合にも、
+BIOS 出力などの機能を使うには差分をあてる必要があります。
+
+  また、日本語化パッケージに付属のプリンタドライバの中でこのパッケージに
+特に対応差分が含まれていないものは次の説明にしたがって作業することによっ
+て PC-9801 や PC/AT で利用できるようになります。
+
+
+-------------------------------
+★ 6.3 その他のプリンタドライバ
+-------------------------------
+
+  今バージョンではプリンタ出力のためのルーチンを全て gp_djgpp.c で用意し
+ています。このためデバイスドライバのソース内で読み込むヘッダファイルを一
+つ追加するだけでこれまで PC-9801 などに対応していなかったプリンタドライ
+バも利用することが出来るようになります。
+
+  この方法で対応できるプリンタドライバは、コードの出力を
+putc(),fputc(),fputs(),fwrite(),fprintf(),vfprintf(),fflush() のストリー
+ム出力関数を使って行なっているものです。write() などの低水準出力関数を使
+うものは対応できません。
+
+  また、プリンタのオープンに gp_printer_open()、クローズに
+gp_printer_close() を使っていなければなりません。gdevprn.c で定義されて
+いる関数を利用しているドライバ (gdevprn.h を取り込んでいるドライバ) であ
+れば間違いなくこの条件を満たしています。
+
+  以下の手順で (再) コンパイルしてください。
+
+(1) このパッケージに付属の gdevgppr.h をドライバのソースファイルでインク
+    ルードする。
+
+    #include "gdevgppr.h"
+
+(2) (再) コンパイルする。
+
+
+========================================================================
+● ７． 前バージョンからの変更点
+========================================================================
+
+  DJ's GPP 対応パッケージの前バージョン (1.2) から以下の点が変更されてい
+ます。
+
+ ・ 不具合の修正
+     ‐ ユーティリティ ps2epsi が正常に動作しなかった不具合を修正。
+     ‐ VFlib 漢字ドライバで、カレントディレクトリに vfontcap があると正
+        常に動作しなかった不具合を修正。
+     ‐ dmprt ドライバで一部のプリンタで正常に動作しなかった不具合を修正。
+ ・ 出力方法に関する機能拡張・変更
+     ‐ IBM PC/AT 互換機のプリンタ BIOS 経由の出力に対応。
+     ‐ プリンタ出力のデフォルトを BIOS に変更。
+     ‐ プリンタ出力の速度を調節できるように変更。
+     ‐ プリンタ出力バッファのサイズを調節できるように変更。
+ ・ デバイスドライバの機能拡張
+     ‐ dmprt ドライバを dviprt 2.42 以降のプリンタ定義ファイルに対応。
+ ・ デバイスドライバの追加
+     ‐ HP DeskJet 505J
+     ‐ Hyper-Frame+
+     ‐ 鮪 フォーマットデータ
+ ・ その他
+     ‐ 機種を自動判別するようにした。
+     ‐ PC-9801, IBM PC/AT 互換機 に対応していないプリンタドライバの組み
+        込みかたを変更 (djdriver.pl と gp_print.h を削除。gdevgppr.h を
+        追加。)
+     ‐ 初期化ファイル gp_djgpp.ps から、ユーザが編集する部分を別ファイ
+        ル gp_site.ps に分離。書式も若干変更。
+
+

+
+   11.11.96. Initial release of the driver 
+
+   25.08.97  Version 1.2. Resolved all but one of the 
+                          known bugs, introduced a couple
+			  of perfomance improvements. Complete
+			  new color-transfer-function handling.
+			  (see gamma).
+
+  01.06.98   Version 1.3  Due to the most welcome contribution
+                          of Martin Gerbershagen (ger@ulm.temic.de),
+                          support for the hp670, hp690 and hp890
+			  and hp1600 has been added. Martin has also
+			  resolved all known bugs.
+
+	     Problems  :  Dark colors are still pale.
+	                  
+
+  The diver needs no longer special switches to be invoked
+  except -sDEVICE=cdj850, or -sDEVICE=CDJ890, or sDEVICE=CDJ670
+  or -sDevice=CDJ1600
+
+  The hp690 is supported through the hp670 device, the hp855, hp870 
+  and the hp1100 trough the hp850 device.
+
+  The following switches are supported.
+
+   -dPapertype= 0  plain paper [default]
+                1  bond paper
+		2  special paper
+		3  glossy film
+		4  transparency film
+
+		Note, currently the lookuptables are not suited
+		for printing on special paper or transperencies.
+		Please revert to the gamma functions in this case.
+
+   -dQuality=  -1 draft     
+                0 normal       [default]
+                1 presentation 
+
+   -dRetStatus= 0 C-RET off
+                1 C-RET on [default]
+
+   -dMasterGamma= 3.0 [default = 1.0]
+    __Note__: To take advantage of the calibrated color-transfer
+              functions, be sure not to have any Gamma-Statements
+	      left! If you need to (i.e. overhead sheets), 
+	      you still can use the gamma-functions, but they will 
+	      override the built-in calibration. To use gamma in the 
+	      traditional way, set MasterGamma to any value greater
+	      1.0 and less 10.0. To adjust individual gamma-values,
+	      you have to additionally set MasterGamma to a value
+	      greater 1.0 and less 10.0
+	      
+	      With the next release, gamma functions will be dropped.
+
+   When using the driver, be aware that printing in 600dpi involves
+   processing of large amounts of data (> 188MB !). Therefore, the
+   driver is not what you would expect to be a fast driver ;-)
+   This is no problem when printing a full sized color page (because
+   printing itself is slow), but it's really annoying if yoy print only
+   text pages. Maybe I can optimize the code for text-only pages in a
+   later release. Right now, it is recommended to use the highest
+   possible optimisation level your compiler offers....
+   For the time beeing, use the cdj550 device with -sBitsPerPixel=3
+   for fast proof-prints. If you simply want to print 600dpi b/w data,
+   use the cdj550 device with -sBitsPerPixel=8 (or 1).
+   
+   Since the printer itself is slow, it may help to set the
+   process-priority of the gs-process to regular or even less. On a
+   486/100MHZ this is still sufficient to maintain a continuos
+   data-flow.
+   Note to OS/2 users: Simply put the gs-window into the background,
+   or minimize it. Also make sure, that print01.sys is invoked without
+   the /irq switch (great speed improvement under warp4).
+
+   The printer default settings compensate for dot-gain by a
+   calibrated color-transfer function. If this appears to be to light
+   for your business-graphs, or for overhead-sheets, feel free to set
+   -dMasterGamma=1.7.
+
+   Furthermore, you may tweak the gammavalues independently by setting
+   -dGammaValC, -dGammaValM, -dGammaValY or -dGammaValK (if not set,
+   the values default to MasterGamma). This will only work, when
+   -dMasterGamma is set to a value greater than 1.0.
+
+   If you want to learn more about gamma, see:
+              
+       ftp://ftp.igd.fhg.de/pub/doc/colour/GammaFAQ.pdf
+
+       Further information, bugs, tips etc, can be found
+       at my website.
+
+   Have fun!

+
+   Note: Depending on how you transfered the files, 
+   you might need to remove some CR-codes used on intel-based machines:
+
+   simply type:  unzip -a hp850.zip
+
+   to compile with gs5.x, simply add 
+
+             DEVICE_DEVS4=cdj850.dev cdj670.dev cdj890.dev cdj1600.dev
+
+   to your makefile. 
+
+   BTW, it is always a good idea to read make.txt found in the
+   gs-distrib before attempting to recompile.....

+● ２． 概要
+========================================================================
+
+  このプリンタドライバは、ビットマップイメージの印字のためのプリンタ命令
+をユーザが定義できるようにし、出来る限り多くの種類のプリンタに対応できる
+ようにしたものです。
+
+  プリンタコードの定義は、MS-DOS 上で広く用いられている TeX 用プリンタド
+ライバ dviprt.exe のプリンタ定義ファイル (拡張子.cfg)、またはそのソース
+ファイル (拡張子.src) を用いる、という方法で行います。
+
+    ※  プリンタ定義ファイルの書式については dviprt のテクニカルマニュア
+      ル texjman.tex (ver. 2.42 以降) をご覧ください。tex???ma.lzh(???
+      はバージョン番号) というファイル名で配布されています。
+
+    ※  dviprt のプリンタ定義ファイルの仕様がバージョン 2.41.8 以降で拡
+      張されました。dmprt の本バージョンではこの新しい仕様にも対応してい
+      ます。
+
+    ※  dviprt.exe は TSG(東京大学理論科学グループ) 及び PC-VAN SSCIENCE
+      の SHIMA さんによる TeX 用プリンタドライバです。PC-VAN では
+      SSCIENCE の OSL、Nifty Serve では FLABO のライブラリの 11 番 (TeX
+      専用)、ASCII NET では pool msdos で入手可能です。また annonymous
+      FTP でも入手できます。
+
+    ※  プリンタ定義ファイルは dviprt.exe のユーティリティパッケージ
+      tex???ut.lzh (??? はバージョン番号) に含まれています。
+
+    ※  dviprt v2.42 の時点で配布パッケージに含まれているプリンタ定義フ
+      ァイルは以下のとおりです。
+
+      これら全てのプリンタでの動作確認が出来ているわけではありません。こ
+      れらのプリンタの中で正常に印字出来ない場合にはご連絡ください。出来
+      る限り対処します。

+● ３． 動作環境
+========================================================================
+
+  ソースファイルは基本的に非機種依存のつもりで書いてあります (ただし
+FreeBSD 上でしか動作確認はおこなっていません)。
+
+  このドライバを組み込むことが出来る Ghostscript のバージョンですが、
+Ghostscript の本体とデバイスドライバとのインタフェースが Ghostscript
+version 4.03 と同様のものならば可能です (2.6.x には組み込めません。
+2.6.x では従来のものを用いて下さい)。
+
+
+========================================================================
+● ４． 導入の手順
+========================================================================
+  ここでは dmprt が組みこんである実行可能形式の gs が既に手元にあるもの
+として説明します。コンパイルが必要な場合はこのドキュメント末尾の「コンパ
+イル」の項目を参照してください。
+
+  dmprt はおおよそ汎用のプリンタドライバですから、逆に言うとユーザが設定
+をおこなってやらないと正しく動作してくれません。
+
+  以下の作業を行います。
+
+(1) 環境設定ファイルの編集
+(2) 環境設定ファイルの指定
+
+-----------------------
+★ 4.1 環境設定ファイル
+-----------------------
+
+  環境設定ファイルでは、プリンタの機種別情報などを指定します。また、印字
+位置の補正などが必要ならばさらにそれを指定します。
+
+
+-----------------------------
+★ 4.2 環境設定ファイルの書式
+-----------------------------
+
+  環境設定ファイル dmp_site.ps の大まかな書式を説明します。項目別の詳細
+な書式は各項目の説明を参照してください。
+
+(1) 設定ファイルの開始・終了コマンド
+
+      付属の dmp_site.ps の最初と最後の行にある 「BeginConfig」 と
+    「EndConfig」 という文字列のことです。設定ファイルの最初と最後の行
+    にそれぞれこれらの文字列がある必要があります。付属の dmp_site.ps を
+    編集して使う場合には、これらの行を削除しないようにしてください。
+
+(2) コメント
+
+      '%' 以降行末まではコメントとして無視されます。
+
+(3) 論理値 (スイッチ)
+
+      true (真 / on) 又は false (偽 / off) のどちらかの値です。
+
+(4) 文字列
+
+      '(' と ')' で囲まれたものが文字列です。これらの括弧の間には余分な
+    空白を含めてはいけません。
+
+(5) 長さ
+      dmp_site.ps の中で「長さ」で指定する項目では単位を付けることが出来
+    ます。使用できる単位は、
+
+     ・ in  インチ
+     ・ cm  センチメートル
+     ・ mm  ミリメートル
+     ・ pt  ポイント (1/72.27 インチ)
+     ・ bp  ビッグポイント (1/72 インチ)
+     ・ dot ドット
+
+    です。単位が指定されない場合は「インチ」を単位として処理します。
+
+      単位を指定する場合には、数値との間に空白文字を少なくとも一つ挿入し
+    てください。空白文字が数値との間にない場合、うまく解釈できません。
+
+      (e.g.)  /defaultsize [ 576 bp 792 bp ]
+
+
+    ※環境設定ファイルは実際には PostScript プログラムとして実行され解釈
+      されています。従って、環境設定ファイル中では PostScript 言語が許す
+      記述は基本的に許されます。
+
+      ただし、その場合に作業の都合上辞書に登録を行なう必要がある場合には
+      環境設定ファイル中でローカルな辞書を作って、その辞書に対して登録を
+      行なってください (dictfull エラーや思わぬ副作用が起きる可能性があ
+      ります)。また、オペランドスタックや辞書スタックを破壊しないように
+      十分に気を付けてください (ゴミを残さないように!!)。
+
+      環境設定ファイル中では Level 2 のオペレータは使わないようにしてく
+      ださい。
+
+-----------------------------
+★ 4.3 環境設定ファイルの項目
+-----------------------------
+
+  環境設定ファイル dmp_site.ps は以下の項目とコメントからなっています。
+
+ /printer     dviprtのプリンタ定義ファイル
+ /resolution  解像度
+ /offset      原点移動量
+ /defaultsize デフォルトの用紙サイズ
+ /margin      印字不可能領域
+ /maxsize     印字可能領域の最大範囲
+ /verbose     おしゃべりモード(^^;
+
+  これらは全て省略可能な項目です。ただし、/printer を設定しない場合には
+ESC/P 24 pins のプリンタコードを用いて出力しますので、これに該当しないプ
+リンタを使用する場合には最低限この項目は設定してください。
+
+  以下に各項目の指定法を説明します。各項目は行単位で指定し、重複した指定
+は最初の指定のみが有効となります。また、設定ファイル中の文字は全て大文字、
+小文字が区別されますので注意してください。
+
+(1) /printer
+
+     ・ 《指定法》
+
+          /printer (ファイル名)
+
+          dviprt の *.cfg/*.src のファイル名を文字列で指定します。拡張子
+        の省略はできません。
+
+          MS-DOS 上で使用する場合、ディレクトリの区切りには '\' ではなく
+        '/' を用いるようにしてください。
+
+     ・ 《指定例》
+
+          /printer (/usr/local/lib/tex/dviprt/escp_24.cfg)
+
+     ・ 《説明》
+
+          dviprt.exe で用いられるプリンタ定義ファイルまたはそのソースフ
+        ァイルを指定します。
+
+          ここで指定されたファイルは
+
+        (A) Ghostscript のライブラリ検索 (use.doc の File searching の項
+            目を参照) に従った検索
+        (B) 指定されたファイル名を環境変数 TEXCFG に設定されたディレクト
+            リ名に連結したファイル名のファイル (環境変数が設定されている
+            場合のみ)
+
+        の順に探されます。
+
+          このファイルは使用するプリンタの機種にあったものを用意する必要
+        があります。
+
+          dviprt は大変多くのユーザを持っているためありがたいことにたく
+        さんのプリンタ定義ファイルが既に作成・公開・配布されています。ま
+        ずは dviprt のユーティリティパッケージ tex???ut.lzh に目的のプリ
+        ンタ定義ファイルが無いかどうか確かめてください。
+
+          運悪くご使用のプリンタ用のプリンタ定義ファイルが tex???ut.lzh
+        に含まれていない場合、そのソースファイルはテキストファイルですの
+        でエディタで作成することが出来ます。
+
+          プリンタ定義ファイルのソースファイルとそれをコンバートしたバイ
+        ナリファイルとはその内容から自動判別しています。
+
+(2) /resolution
+
+     ・ 《指定法》
+
+          /resolution [ 横の解像度 縦の解像度 ]
+
+        dot/inch(dpi) 単位での実数表現。
+
+     ・ 《設定例》
+
+          /resolution [ 160 180 ]
+
+     ・ 《説明》
+
+          解像度を指定します。通常はプリンタ定義ファイルに記録してあるプ
+        リンタ固有の解像度を参照しますのでこの項目の設定は必要ありません
+        が dviprt のプリンタ定義ファイルは縦横の解像度が同じであることを
+        仮定していますのでこれに該当しないプリンタ (縦横の解像度が異なる
+        プリンタ) では実行毎に (Ghostscript の)-r オプションを指定しなけ
+        ればなりません。また、解像度が記録されていない古いバージョンのプ
+        リンタ定義ファイルを使用する場合でも同様です。
+
+          解像度の優先順位は、
+
+        (A) Ghostscript 起動時の -r オプションによる指定
+        (B) 環境設定ファイル中の "/resolution" の項目による指定
+        (C) プリンタ定義ファイル中の解像度
+        (D) 180dpi(デフォルト)
+
+        です。
+
+(3) /offset
+
+     ・ 《設定法》
+
+          /offset  [ 横の移動量 縦の移動量 ]
+
+        長さによる指定。
+
+     ・ 《設定例》
+
+          /offset [ 0.0 -0.2 ]
+
+     ・ 《説明》
+
+          原点 (出力イメージの左下角) の横 / 縦方向の移動量を指定します。
+
+          印字可能領域の枠から覗いて見える部分がここで指定された分だけ平
+        行移動する、というイメージを持っていただけばいいでしょう。
+
+          用紙右、上方向がそれぞれの正方向です。
+
+          省略された場合は縦横双方向 0 インチです。
+
+          このパッケージには位置合わせのための PS ファイル (testpage.ps)
+        が付属しています。このファイルは用紙の縁から、内側 1.5cm、1inch、
+        及び 3cm の位置に 1 dot 幅の細い線で枠を書くだけのものです。
+
+          testpage.ps では用紙サイズは、デバイスドライバの描画範囲に等し
+        いものとみなされます。例えば -sPAPERSIZE=b5 というオプションを付
+        けて Ghostscript を起動すれば用紙サイズは B5 であると仮定され、
+        また、Ghostscript に描画範囲を指定するオプション (-g、
+        -sPAPERSIZE) を付けずに起動した場合には、デバイスドライバのデフ
+        ォルトの描画範囲が用紙サイズであるとされます。
+
+          -sPAPERSIZE オプションと -g オプションについては Ghostscript
+        のドキュメント use.doc をご覧ください。
+
+        例えば、次のようにします。
+
+          gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=dmprt -sPAPERSIZE=b5 -- testpage.ps
+
+          このファイル testpage.ps の出力位置がずれる場合には正しい位置
+        に枠がくるように /offset の値を調節してください。
+
+(4) /defaultsize
+
+     ・ 《設定法》
+
+          /defaultsize  [ 幅 高 ]
+
+        長さによる指定。
+
+     ・ 《設定例》
+
+          /defaultsize [ 8.0 11.0 ]
+
+     ・ 《説明》
+
+          Ghostscript の起動オプションで印字領域の幅・高の指定 (-g オプ
+        ション、-sPAPERSIZE オプション) がない場合の印字領域を指定します。
+
+          指定されなかった場合には、幅 8.3 インチ、高 11.7 インチです。
+
+(5) /margin
+
+     ・ 《設定法》
+
+          /margin  [ 左 下 右 上 ]
+
+        長さによる指定。
+
+     ・ 《設定例》
+
+          /margin [ 3.675 mm 12.7 mm 3.675 mm 6.5 mm ]
+
+     ・ 《説明》
+
+          用紙のうちプリンタが印字することが出来ない部分を用紙上下左右の
+        端からの長さで指定します。
+
+          ここで指定された領域のイメージはプリンタに出力されません (c.f.
+        /maxsize)。
+
+          指定されなかった場合はは上下左右全て 0 インチです。
+
+(6) /maxsize
+
+     ・ 《設定法》
+
+          /maxsize  [ 幅 高 ]
+
+        長さによる指定。
+
+     ・ 《設定例》
+
+          /maxsize [ 8.0 11.0 ]
+
+     ・ 《説明》
+
+          プリンタの印字可能領域の最大サイズを指定します。このサイズから
+        はみ出す部分は指定された用紙サイズやマージンにかかわらず出力され
+        なくなります (右、上が切れることになります)。
+
+          例えば最大印字可能幅を越えるイメージを送った場合にそのぶんを無
+        視せずに次の行に折り返して印字してしまうプリンタを使用している場
+        合や、長すぎるページを出力した場合に次の用紙に続きを出力してしま
+        う場合などにこの項目を設定してください。
+
+          0 又は負の値は「無限大」を意味します。幅、高さの指定は独立です。
+        すなわち例えば幅が 8 インチ、高さが無限大、という指定も可能です。
+
+          (e.g.) /maxsize [ 8.0 0 ]
+
+          指定されなかった場合には縦横双方向が無限大です。
+
+          出力されるイメージのサイズが用紙サイズからマージンを差し引いた
+        サイズより大きいときに出力イメージのサイズをここで設定された値に
+        置き換えて処理されます (設定された値が 0 以下であればこの置き換
+        えは行われません)。
+
+(7) /verbose
+
+     ・ 《設定法》
+
+          /verbose 論理値
+
+     ・ 《設定例》
+
+          /verbose true
+
+     ・ 《説明》
+
+        デバイスドライバの動作状態を詳しく表示するかどうかの指定です。出
+        力中のページの通し番号や出力コードのバイト数などが表示されます。
+
+        デフォルトでは false (off) です (何も表示されません)。
+
+        この項目が true (on) に設定してあっても、Ghostscript の起動オプ
+        ションで -q オプション (QUIET) が指定してあれば、この項目の設定
+        が off の場合と同じ動作をします。
+
+-----------------------------
+★ 4.4 環境設定ファイルの指定
+-----------------------------
+  dmprt ドライバが組み込まれた Ghostscript は起動時に dmp_init.ps 及び
+dmp_site.ps を Ghostscript のファイル検索パス上から読み込みます。これら
+のファイルは Ghostscript のファイル検索パス上に置いてください。
+dmp_site.ps(環境定義ファイル) が見つからなければ読み込みを諦めてデフォル
+トの設定 (ESC/P 24 pin) を用います。
+
+  dmp_site.ps の代わりに別のファイルを指定して読み込むことも可能です。
+Ghostscript 起動時にそのファイル名を -sDMPCONFIG= ファイル名 のように指
+定してください。この場合に指定するファイルを置くディレクトリも
+dmp_init.ps などと同様です。
+
+  (e.g.) gs -sDEVICE=dmprt -sDMPCONFIG=dmp_local.ps -dNOPAUSE -- tiger.ps
+
+
+========================================================================
+● ５． 使用法
+========================================================================
+
+  dmp_site.ps の設定以外には特別なことを行う必要はありません。gs のデバ
+イスとして "dmprt" を指定して起動してください (他のデバイスドライバと同
+様の使い方)。
+
+  (e.g.) gs -sDEVICE=dmprt sample.ps

+	gdevfmlbp.c  -  Fujitsu FMLBP2xx 用デバイスドライバ
+
+			Version 1.2   1998/03/30
+
+◆ はじめに
+
+  これは、ghostscript 2.6.1 で、FMLBP2xx 系のページプリンタを使うための
+  デバイスドライバです。
+
+
+◆ インストール方法
+
+ 1. gdevfmlbp.c を ghostscript 2.6.1 のソースプログラムを展開した
+    ディレクトリにコピーします。
+
+ 2. Makefile に gdevfmlbp.mak を追加します。
+
+ 3. Makefile の DEVICE_DEVS に fmlbp.dev を加えます。
+
+    例: DEVICE_DEVS=x11.dev fmlbp.dev
+			    ~~~~~~~~~
+ 4. make コマンドで gs をコンパイルし、インストールします。
+
+
+◆ 使用方法
+
+   デバイスドライバの選択は -sDEVICE オプションによって行ないます。
+
+    例: gs -sDEVICE=fmlbp
+
+   (注意)プリンタ本体のエミュレーション設定を FMモードに設定してください。
+
+   デフォルトの解像度は 400dpi です。240dpi で印刷する場合は、次のように
+   -r オプションで指定します。
+
+    例: gs -sDEVICE=fmlbp  -r240
+
+   (注意) -r オプションの値はチェックしていません。
+
+   用紙サイズを指定する場合には、-sPAPERSIZE オプションで指定します。
+   指定可能なサイズは、a3, a4, a5, b4, b5, legal, letter です。
+   デフォルトの用紙は a4 です。a3 を指定する時は次のように指定します。
+
+    例: gs -sDEVICE=fmlbp  -sPAPERSIZE=a3
+
+
+◆ バグ/制限事項
+
+ o 動作確認は、Solaris上の ghostscript 2.6.1j と FMLBP226 で行なってます。
+
+ o おそらく Aladdin 版の ghostcript 5.01 でも動作すると思いますが、確認
+   していません。5.01 では gdevfmlbp.mk5 を gdevfmlbp.mak の代りに試して
+   みてください。
+
+ o 用紙は a3, a4, a5, b4, b5, legal, letter, ハガキ に対応させましたが、
+   a4 以外は、あまりテストしていませんので、問題があるかもしれません。
+
+
+◆ おわりに
+
+ o この FMLBP2xx 用ドライバは、成松宏氏の ESC/Page 用ドライバ gdevepag を
+   後藤和茂氏 <goto@statabo.rim.or.jp> が、FMLBP2xx 用に改造した物です。
+   修正および拡張を 中山正一 <naka@fadev.fvd.fujitsu.co.jp> が行っています。
+
+   なお、ESC/Page 用ドライバは、Tom Quinn氏 <trq@prg.oxford.ac.uk> 作成の
+   lbp8 用ドライバを成松宏氏 <nari@lsi.tmg.nec.co.jp> が、ESC/Page 用に
+   改造した物です。
+
+ o 配布条件は、もとのソースファイルと同様 GPL に従います。
+
+ o 私も富士通VLSI(株)も富士通(株)も、本ソフトウェアの修正その他、如何なる
+   保守についても義務を負いません。また、本ソフトウェアを使用することに
+   よって如何なる損害が生じても一切責任を負いません。
+   各自の責任でプログラムをご使用ください。
+
+ o ご意見・ご要望などは、naka@fadev.fvd.fujitsu.co.jp へお願いします。

+
+========================================================================
+● １． 概要
+========================================================================
+
+まぐろーだー (.mag) フォーマットの画像データを出力するためのドライバです。
+16 色と 256 色に対応しています。
+
+========================================================================
+● ２． 組み込み
+========================================================================
+
+gdevmag.c を他のソースプログラムと同じディレクトリに置き、Makefile の
+DEVICE_DEVS (または、DEVICE_DEVS1〜9) に mag16.dev (16 色)、
+mag256.dev(256 色) を追加し、Makefile に gdevmag.mak の内容を追加して
+make を実行してください。
+
+========================================================================
+● ３． 使い方
+========================================================================
+
+BMP や PCX などの他の画像フォーマットドライバと同様です。gs を起動すると
+きに -sDEVICE=mag16、-sDEVICE=mag256 というオプションを付けてください。
+
+  (例) gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=mag16 -sOutputFile=golfer.mag -- golfer.ps
+
+    ※一つの *.mag ファイルには一つの画像しか含めることが出来ませんから、
+      複数ページから成る PostScirpt コードを鮪形式に変換する場合には
+      -sOutputFile オプションで複数のファイルに出力するように指定してく
+      ださい。
+
+        (例) gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=mag256 -sOutputFile=lines%d.mag -- lines.ps

+gdevmjc-0.8no2 大森紀人 ohmori@p.chiba-u.ac.jp
+
+このドライバは gdevmjc-0.8 をもとにして作られています。
+色あいなどは gdevmjc-0.8 そのままです。
+また、Ghostscript 5.10 で動作させることを前提としています。
+
+1. 対応デバイス
+mj700v2c : EPSON MachJet シリーズで CMYK 4色を印刷できるカラー用のドライバ
+mj500c   : EPSON MachJet シリーズで CMY or K, CMY + K 用のプリンタ用のドライバ
+mj6000c  : EPSON MJ-830C/MJ-930C/MJ-6000C
+           (モノクロ印刷時の高速化に対応している)
+mj8000c  : EPSON MJ-8000C
+           (mj6000c と A2 サイズのマージンが異なる)
+
+**************************************************************
+*※ CMY or K プリンタ: MJ-500C, MJ-510C                      *
+*   CMY + K プリンタ: MJ-800C, MJ-3000C                      *
+*    (これは普通紙には CMYK 印刷できない仕様になっています。)*
+**************************************************************
+
+またカラーに対応していない MachJet でも -dBitsBitsPerPixel=8 を
+指定すればモノクロで使えるようです。
+
+2. 対応解像度
+mj700v2c, mj6000c, mj8000c : 180x180 dpi (-r180 オプション)
+                             360x360 dpi (-r360 オプション) - デフォルト
+                             720x720 dpi (-r720 オプション)
+mj500c                     : 360x360 dpi (-r360 オプション) - デフォルト
+
+
+3. カラー/モノクロ切替え
+-dBitsPerPixel=8     モノクロ印刷
+-dBitsPerPixel=32    カラー印刷 (デフォルト)
+
+4. その他のオプション
+-dMicroweave         マイクロウィーブをオンにする。
+                     (180 dpi ではマイクロウィーブは使えません)
+                     デフォルトでオンなのでオフにするためには、
+                     -dMicroweave=false オプションを使用してください。
+-dUnidirectional     単方向印字にする。
+-dDotSize            ドットサイズを制御する。
+-dDensity            全体の濃さを調整する - デフォルト 1024
+-dCyan               シアンの濃さを調整する - デフォルト 1024
+-dMagenta            マゼンタの濃さを調整する - デフォルト 1024
+-dYellow             黄色の濃さを調整する - デフォルト 1024
+-dBlack              黒色の濃さを調整する - デフォルト 1024
+
+モノクロ印刷時には -dDensity は働きません。-dBlack のみで色調整を
+してください。
+
+5. 最高画質
+このドライバで最高画質をだすためには
+-dMicroweave -dUnidirectional オプションを指定してください。
+
+6. gdevmjc-0.8 のバグで修正したもの
+○Compaq Tru64 UNIX、Alpha Linux 出力がおかしくなるバグ
+○モノクロ印刷時に色調整ができないバグ

+
+  MICROLINE620CL 用 ghostscript ドライバ
+
+					Mar. 16, 1998	N.Tagawa
+
+	$Id$
+
+
+  このドライバは、沖データの MICROLINE620CL を ghostscript で使うため
+のものです。gs は、5.10 に対応しており、Linux-2.0.33(Debian-1.3.1) で
+動作を確認しています。
+
+
+  (1) コンパイル方法
+  他のプリンタドライバと同様の手順でコンパイルできるはずです。
+gdevml6.c ファイルを gs のディレクトリに置き、gdevml6.mak の内容を 
+devs.mak の適当な場所に追加します。
+  gcc-head.mak などの DEVICE_DEVS3 あたりに ml600.dev を追加し、
+tar_cat を実行します。ここらへんは、環境によって変わってくるので、gs 
+に付属のドキュメントを参考にして下さい。後は make でコンパイルできるは
+ずです。
+
+
+  (2) 使い方
+  デバイスとして -sDEVICE=ml600 を指定します。デフォルトの解像度は 600
+x 600 DPI ですが、-r オプションで解像度を変える事ができます。-r300 で 
+300 DPI、-r600x1200 で 600 x 1200 DPI になります。
+
+  あまり細かい事はわからないのですが、トレーの切替えや、用紙の厚さなど
+も変えられるはずです。ただ、PS からどうやって指定すればいいかわからな
+いので、とりあえずデフォルトにしてあります。年賀状を印刷したい時は、コー
+ドを変更して再コンパイルして下さい。^^;
+
+
+  (3) その他
+  このドライバは、MICROLINE620CL 用ですが、たぶん MICROLINE600CL でも
+動くと思います(両方共 IPL だそうですから)。ML-4w で動くかどうかはわか
+りません。持っている人がいたらぜひ試してみて下さい。
+
+  このドライバは無保証です、が、バグの指摘等あればなるべく対応したいと
+思っていますので、よろしくお願いします。
+
+
+  では、お楽しみ下さい:-）

+○コメント
+
+◇ DJ's GPP を使ってコンパイルするには、淺山和典さんが作られた
+『Ghostscript 2.6.1 DJ's GPP 化パッケージ』を利用することで可能です。
+PC-VAN のサイエンス SIG (SSCIENCE) や Nifty Serve のソフトウェア工房
+(FLABO) から入手できるようになるそうです。
+ 淺山さんのメールアドレスは、NIFTY: GHF01532, PC-VAN: TPM03937 です。
+
+◇ zkfjtex.c など一部のプログラムは char 型が signed char 型であること
+を前提としています。そのため、MIPS 系のコンパイラなど char を unsigned
+char として処理するコンパイラについては -signed オプションか何かを用い
+て char を signed char として処理するように設定して下さい。
+
+◇ X11R5 PCFフォントまたはX11R4 SNFフォントを利用する際、X11環境(サー
+バ、共有ライブラリなど)は必要ありません。フォント・ファイルさえ読み込
+むことができれば漢字を表示することができます。
+
+◇ 質問、要望、バグリポート、改良案など歓迎します。

+ghostscript-fonts-2.6.1.tar.gz を展開して下さい。
+
+  例) gsdatadir が標準設定の /usr/local/lib/ghostscript であるとき
+
+	% cd /usr/local/lib/ghostscript
+	% gunzip < ghostscript-fonts-2.6.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -
+
+
+[2] 漢字フォントのコンフィギュレーション
+
+(1) Makefile の gsdatadir マクロによって指定したディレクトリの下に
+kanji というサブディレクトリがあるので、そのディレクトリに移動して下さい。
+
+  例) gsdatadir が標準設定の /usr/local/lib/ghostscript であるとき
+
+	% cd /usr/local/lib/ghostscript
+	% cd kanji
+
+
+(2) 下に列挙したテンプレートファイルの中から使いたいフォントに応じて、
+いずれかをコピーし kconfig.ps をつくって下さい。

+(3) kconfig.ps を各サイトの環境に合わせて編集して下さい。通常、変更し
+なければならないのはフォントファイル名だけです。
+
+  kconfig.ps の詳細については「○漢字コンフィギュレーションファイルに
+ついて」を参照して下さい。
+
+
+[3] 漢字フォントの表示テスト
+
+  サンプルプログラムを gs に実行させ、漢字フォントが正しく表示されるこ
+とを確かめて下さい。
+
+	hankaku.ps	半角文字の一覧を表示します。

+	fmaptype.ps	複合フォントのフォントマッピングのテストです。
+	vchars.ps	縦書き文字の一覧を表示します。
+	article9.ps	日本国憲法の第九条です。
+
+  サンプルプログラムは、漢字フォントディレクトリにあるのでディレクトリ
+パスを指定する必要はありません。
+
+	例) % gs hankaku.ps
+
+(注) マシンの製造元から提供されているSNFファイルを使用した場合、文字が
+   正しく表示されないことがあります。これは、bdftosnf.h のデフォルト値
+	#define DEFAULTGLPAD		1
+	#define DEFAULTBITORDER		MSBFirst
+	#define DEFAULTBYTEORDER	MSBFirst
+	#define DEFAULTSCANUNIT		1
+   が、SNFファイルのフォーマットと一致してないことが原因と考えられます。
+   もし、文字の表示が正しくない場合には、zkfsnf.c の37行め〜53行めを変
+   更してみることをお勧めします。
+
+
+
+○漢字コンフィギュレーションファイルについて
+
+  このファイルは漢字フォントを定義するためのものです。デフォルトでは、
+kconfig.ps という名前のファイルが使われますが、コマンド・オプションに
+よって変更することもできます。

+  漢字フォントの定義は次のフォーマットによって行ないます。
+
+	フォント名  ユニークID  [ フォントファイル名 ]  コマンド
+
+  ◎フォント名
+	定義する漢字フォントの名前です。標準的な名前は、/Ryumin-Light 
+      と /GothicBBB-Medium の二つです。
+
+  ◎ユニークID
+	定義する漢字フォントを識別するための番号です。取り敢えず、
+      4300000番台から200おきに指定すればよいでしょう。
+
+  ◎フォントファイル名
+	使用するフォントファイルの名前です。このフィールドは、コマンド
+      によって書式が異なります。テンプレートファイルのコメントを参照し
+      て下さい。
+
+  ◎コマンド
+	漢字フォントを定義するためのコマンドです。
+
+  例えば、"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/k24.pcf"という名前のX11R5 PCFフォン
+トファイルを利用して /Ryumin-Light という漢字フォントを定義するときに
+は、次の文を漢字コンフィギュレーションファイルに書いておきます。
+
+  /Ryumin-Light  4300000 (/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/k24.pcf) pcfkanji
+
+  この文を書くことによって、以下の漢字フォントが利用できるようになりま
+す。
+
+    /Ryumin-Light.r##	(## = 21〜7E)		横書きJISコード漢字
+    /Ryumin-Light.r##v	(## = 21, 22, 24, 25)	縦書きJISコード漢字
+    /Ryumin-Light.sr##	(## = 81〜9F, E0〜EA)	横書きシフトJIS漢字
+    /Ryumin-Light.sr##v	(## = 81〜83)		縦書きシフトJIS漢字
+
+    /Ryumin-Light.Roman		半角英数
+    /Ryumin-Light.Hiragana	半角ひらがな
+    /Ryumin-Light.Katakana	半角カタカナ
+    /Ryumin-Light.Hankaku	半角英数・ひらがな・カタカナ
+    /Ryumin-Light.SuppK		シフトJIS用半角カタカナ
+
+    /Ryumin-Light-H		横書きJISコード漢字
+    /Ryumin-Light-V		縦書きJISコード漢字
+    /Ryumin-Light-Ext-H		横書き拡張JISコード漢字
+    /Ryumin-Light-Ext-V		縦書き拡張JISコード漢字
+    /Ryumin-Light-EUC-H		横書きEUCコード漢字
+    /Ryumin-Light-EUC-V		縦書きEUCコード漢字
+    /Ryumin-Light-RKSJ-H	横書き半角英数・片仮名・シフトJIS漢字
+    /Ryumin-Light-RKSJ-V	縦書き半角英数・片仮名・シフトJIS漢字
+    /Ryumin-Light-83pv-RKSJ-H	横書き半角英数・片仮名・シフトJIS漢字
+
+  拡張JISコード用の漢字フォントも定義されますが、出力される文字は当然
+フォントファイルの内容によって決まります。したがって、フォントファイル
+に含まれない文字は表示されませんし、JIS-78になるかJIS-83になるかもフォ
+ントファイルに依存します。
+
+
+[2] 漢字フォントの別名の定義
+
+  漢字フォントに別名を定義するときには、copyfont というオペレータを使い
+ます。copyfont のフォーマットは次の通りです。
+
+  既存のフォント名	別名	copyfont
+
+例えば、/GothicBBB-Medium-83pv-RKSJ-H の別名として /ChuGothicBBB-Medium を
+定義するときには、漢字コンフィギュレーションファイルに次のように書きます。
+
+  /GothicBBB-Medium-83pv-RKSJ-H	/ChuGothicBBB-Medium	copyfont
+
+
+
+○コマンドオプション
+
+gs コマンドのオプションとして以下のものが使えます。
+
+    -dNOKANJI		漢字フォントを定義しなくなります。
+    -sKCONFIG=pcf.ps	漢字コンフィギュレーションファイルを指定します。
+
+
+
+○漢字フォントのライセンスについて
+
+以下は漢字フォントのライセンスについての情報です。参考にして下さい。
+
+
+◇ Zeit「書体倶楽部」
+
+  Zeitファイル用のプログラムを作られた川本さんが問い合わせて下さったと
+ころ、「フォントデータの読出しは、ユーザが書体倶楽部を購入しフリーウェ
+アによって読出すのであれば構わない」という回答だったそうです。
+
+
+◇ 大日本印刷「JTeX用フォント」
+
+  筑波大学の木本豪さんが大日本印刷に問い合わせて下さったところ、「もと
+もとのライセンス契約がTeX用となっているので、新たな形態で使用する場合
+大日本印刷の方へ連絡する必要がある」という回答だったそうです。
+
+以下は、木本さんのメールからの引用です。
+
+大日本印刷のフォントを使うにあたっては、
+---- ここから ----
+
+「TeX のフォントを GhostScript のソフトウエアで使うために
+こうこうします」
+という旨のメモを、下記に送ってくれればいいそうです。
+
+〒162-01 新宿区市ヶ谷加賀町 1-1-1 
+大日本印刷（株） CTS 事業部 CTS 開発本部システム開発第 1 部
+斉藤 雅
+
+  そうすれば、（すでに大日本印刷の手元にある）使用許諾契約書
+に添付しておく、とのことです。
+  （すでにライセンスを持っていると言う前提で話をしました。）
+  PK を変換して使うか、GhostScript の方を PK に対応させて
+使うか、ということについても、上のメモに実際の使用形態を
+書けばどちらでもかまわないそうです。

+
+Everyone is permitted to copy, modify and redistribute this package
+only for nonprofit use.
+
+
+How to install (UNIX)
+=====================
+
+[1] Building Ghostscript
+
+(1) Extract source files from the original distribution of Ghostscript
+    version 2.6.1.
+    This package is based on the source files to which the following
+    patches are applied.
+        ghostscript-2.6.1.fix-01.gz
+        ghostscript-2.6.1.fix-02.gz
+        ghostscript-2.6.1.fix-03.gz
+        ghostscript-2.6.1.fix-04.gz
+
+(2) Extract the contents of this package in the directory containing
+    the original source files.
+
+(3) Apply a patch file `gs261j.diff' to the original source files.
+
+(4) Copy unix-cc.mak, unix-gcc.mak or unix-ansi.mak onto Makefile, and
+    edit it appropriately. At least four configurations described
+    below must be done.
+
+ 1. Set prefix, exec_prefix, bindir, datadir, and gsdatadir macros to
+    specify the directory to which Ghostscript will be installed.
+
+
+ 2. Set CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, EXTRALIBS, XINCLUDE, and XLIBDIRS macros to
+    configure compilation options.
+    
+ 3. Choose the features of Kanji font files to be included and add
+    some of the symbols listed below to FEATURE_DEVS.
+
+	kfpcf.dev	X11R5 PCF font files.
+	kfsnf.dev	X11R4 SNF font files.
+	kfsony.dev	Sony vector font files.
+	kfzeit.dev	Zeit format font files.
+	kfztbez.dev	Zeit JG format font files.
+	kfjtex.dev	JTeX PK font files.
+
+  Examples)
+      To include the features of PCF font files, SNF font files, Zeit
+      format font files, Zeit JG format font files, and JTeX PK font files.
+
+	FEATURE_DEVS=filter.dev dps.dev level2.dev kanji.dev \
+		     kfpcf.dev kfsnf.dev kfzeit.dev kfztbez.dev kfjtex.dev
+	
+      To include the feature of Sony vector font files only.
+
+	FEATURE_DEVS=filter.dev dps.dev level2.dev kanji.dev \
+		     kfsony.dev
+
+      To include the features of PCF font files, SNF font files, Zeit
+      format font files, Zeit JG format font files, JTeX PK font files,
+      and Sony vector font files.
+
+	FEATURE_DEVS=filter.dev dps.dev level2.dev kanji.dev \
+		     kfpcf.dev kfsnf.dev kfzeit.dev kfztbez.dev kfjtex.dev \
+                     kfsony.dev
+
+
+ 4. Choose the devices to be included and add the symbols for them to
+    DEVICE_DEVS.
+
+  Example)
+      To include the device driver of X11.
+
+	DEVICE_DEVS=x11.dev
+
+    If you want to use the device drivers contained in this package,
+    see documents in the `drivers' subdirectory.
+
+
+(5) MAKE and install Ghostscript.
+
+(6) Extract font files from ghostscript-fonts-2.6.1.tar.gz into the
+    directory specified by the gsdatadir macro in Makefile.
+
+  Example)
+      When gsdatadir is the default value (/usr/local/lib/ghostscript) :
+
+        % cd /usr/local/lib/ghostscript
+        % gunzip < ghostscript-fonts-2.6.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -
+
+
+[2] Configuring Kanji Fonts
+
+(1) Change the working directory to the `kanji' directory which is a
+    subdirectory of the directory specified by the gsdatadir macro in
+    Makefile.
+
+  Example)
+      When gsdatadir is the default value (/usr/local/lib/ghostscript) :
+
+        % cd /usr/local/lib/ghostscript
+        % cd kanji
+
+(2) Copy one of the following template files onto `kconfig.ps'.
+
+	pcf.ps	 for X11R5 PCF font files.
+	snf.ps	 for X11R4 SNF font files.
+	sony.ps	 for Sony vector font files.
+	zeit.ps	 for Zeit format font files.
+	ztbez.ps for Zeit JG format font files.
+	jtex.ps  for JTeX PK font files.
+
+(3) Edit `kconfig.ps' appropriately. Normally, you have only to change
+    the names of font files.
+
+  The details of `kconfig.ps' are described in the section ``Kanji
+  Configuration File''.
+
+
+[3] Testing Kanji fonts.
+
+  Execute the following sample programs with gs and verify Kanji fonts
+  are displayed correctly.
+
+	hankaku.ps	A list of half-width Kanji characters.
+	allkanji.ps	A list of Kanji characters.
+	fmaptype.ps	A test program of the composite font mapping.
+	vchars.ps	A list of characters for vertical writing.
+	article9.ps	Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan.
+
+  Because sample programs are contained in the Kanji library directory,
+  you need not specify a directory path.
+
+	Example)
+	    % gs hankaku.ps
+
+Note
+----
+   If you use X11R4 SNF font files which are provided by manufactures
+   (i.e. not made from the MIT distribution), it is possible that
+   Kanji characters are not displayed correctly. This is because the
+   SNF format is dependent on X server and the default values defined
+   in bdftosnf.h is not appropriate to the server. Edit lines from 37
+   to 53 in zkfsnf.c to solve this problem.
+
+
+
+Kanji Configuration File
+========================
+
+  Kanji fonts for Ghostscript are defined in the Kanji configuration
+  file. The name of this file is `kconfig.ps' by default, but it can
+  be changed by -sKCONFIG switch (see the section `Command switches').
+
+[1] Definition of Kanji Fonts
+
+  Kanji fonts are defined in the following format.
+
+	FontName  UniqueID  [ FileName ]  Operator
+
+    FontName
+	is a name of the Kanji font to be defined.
+        `/Ryumin-Light' and `/GothicBBB-Medium' are standard Kanji fonts.
+
+    UniqueID
+	is a unique identifier of the font.
+	Normally, the identifiers may be set from 4300000 with 200
+        differences.
+
+    FileName
+	is the name of the font file to be used.
+	The rule of this field is determined by `Operator', so see
+        comments in the template files for details
+
+    Operator
+	is a Ghostscript operator to define Kanji font.
+
+  For example, if you want to define a Kanji font with a name
+  `/Ryumin-Light' using a X11R5 PCF font file whose path name is
+  "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/k24.pcf", you will write the following line
+  in the Kanji configuration file.
+
+  /Ryumin-Light  4300000 (/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/k24.pcf) pcfkanji
+
+  With this line, the following Kanji fonts will be available.
+
+    /Ryumin-Light.r##	(## = 21 - 7E)		horizontal JIS  base Kanji
+    /Ryumin-Light.r##v	(## = 21, 22, 24, 25)	vertical   JIS  base Kanji
+    /Ryumin-Light.sr##	(## = 81 - 9F, E0 - EA)	horizontal SJIS base Kanji
+    /Ryumin-Light.sr##v	(## = 81 - 83)		vertical   SJIS base Kanji
+
+    /Ryumin-Light.Roman		half-width alphanumeric characters
+    /Ryumin-Light.Hiragana	half-width Hiragana
+    /Ryumin-Light.Katakana	half-width Katakana
+    /Ryumin-Light.Hankaku	half-width alphanumerics, Hiragana, Katakana
+    /Ryumin-Light.SuppK		half-width Katakana for SJIS
+
+    /Ryumin-Light-H		horizontal JIS          Kanji
+    /Ryumin-Light-V		vertical   JIS          Kanji
+    /Ryumin-Light-Ext-H		horizontal Extended JIS Kanji
+    /Ryumin-Light-Ext-V		vertical   Extended JIS Kanji
+    /Ryumin-Light-EUC-H		horizontal EUC          Kanji
+    /Ryumin-Light-EUC-V		vertical   EUC          Kanji
+    /Ryumin-Light-RKSJ-H	horizontal Roman, Katakana, SJIS Kanji
+    /Ryumin-Light-RKSJ-V	vertical   Roman, Katakana, SJIS Kanji
+    /Ryumin-Light-83pv-RKSJ-H	horizontal Roman, Katakana, SJIS Kanji
+
+  Although Kanji fonts in Extended JIS Encoding are defined,
+  characters to be displayed are determined by the contents of font
+  files. For the same reason, the Kanji encoding such as JIS-78 and
+  JIS-83 are also determined by font files.
+
+[2] Definition of Aliases
+
+  An operator `copykanji' can be used to define aliases of Kanji fonts.
+  The following is the format of `copykanji'.
+
+	FontName   NewName  copykanji
+
+  For example, the following line defines an alias `/ChuGothicBBB-Medium'
+  for the font `/GothicBBB-Medium-83pv-RKSJ-H'.
+
+	/GothicBBB-Medium-83pv-RKSJ-H  /ChuGothicBBB-Medium  copykanji
+
+
+Command Switches
+================
+
+New command switches are available.
+
+    -dNOKANJI		Suppress installing Kanji fonts.
+    -sKCONFIG=foo.ps	Define the name of the Kanji configuration file.

+Patches
+=======
+
+bfont.h
+  The prototype declaration of make_composite_font() and
+  make_descender_fonts() are added.
+
+gs_init.ps
+  Base font operators are replaced with composite font operators.
+  `kinit.ps' and `metrics2.ps' are invoked.
+
+gs_fonts.ps
+  The problem is fixed that the findfont operator leaves a font name
+  in the stack when it is in QUIET mode and the font file is not found.
+  
+gschar.c
+  gs_setcachedevice2() is adapted to the vertical writing.
+  The vertical writing feature is implemented.
+  gs_setrootfont() and gs_currentrootfont() are defined.
+
+gschar.h
+  The prototype declaration of gs_setrootfont() and gs_currentrootfont()
+  are added.
+
+gsfont.c
+  The font cache is enlarged for the efficiency of Kanji fonts.
+  The problem is fixed that composite fonts, which have no UniqueID,
+  are cached by makefont.
+
+gzstate.h
+  rootfont is added into the graphics state.
+
+zchar.c
+  zrootfont() is changed to call gs_currentrootfont().
+
+zfont.c
+  zsetfont() is adapted to rootfont.
+  make_font() calls make_composite_font() when it transforms composite
+  fonts.
+  make_composite_font() is defined.
+	
+zfont0.c
+  zbuildfont0() is changed to call make_descender_fonts().
+  make_descender_fonts() is defined.
+
+zfont2.c
+  A `fake UniqueID' facility is implemented to enhance the efficiency
+  of the `makefont' cache.
+
+gs.mak
+  The features of composite fonts and Kanji fonts are added.
+
+cc-head.mak
+gcc-head.mak
+ansihead.mak
+  `$(gsdatadir)/kanji' is added to the GS_LIB_DEFAULT macro.
+  `-DCOMPFONT -DWMODE -DKANJI' is added to the compilation flags.
+  `kanji.dev kfpcf.dev kfsnf.dev kfzeit.dev kfztbez.dev kfjtex.dev' is
+  added to the FEATURE_DEVS macro.
+
+unixhead.mak
+  The dependency `$(AK)' is removed from the implicit rule `.c.o'.
+
+unixtail.mak
+  The name of the output file is changed from `gs' to` $(GS)$(XE)'.
+
+unix-cc.mak
+unix-gcc.mak
+unix-ansi.mak
+  These files are updated according to the changes of gs.mak,
+  cc-head.mak, gcc-head.mak, and ansihead.mak.
